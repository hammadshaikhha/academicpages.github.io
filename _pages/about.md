**Welcome to my website!**

I am a PhD student in the Department of Economics at the University of Toronto. My research interests are in Public Economics and Economics of Education.

My second year paper examines racial achievement gaps using recent nationally representative panel data sets from the U.S. and assesses the sensitivity of the primary results to test score scaling decesions. I am also doing research on identifying low-cost interventions that guides academic decesion making for students in university.
