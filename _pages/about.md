**Welcome to my website!**

I am a PhD student in the Department of Economics at the University of Toronto. My research interests are in Public Economics, Experimental Economics, Applied Econometrics, and Economics of Education.

My second year paper examines racial achievement gaps using recent nationally representative panel data sets from the U.S. and assesses the sensitivity of the primary results to the choice of test score scale. I am also doing research on identifying low-cost interventions that guides academic decision making for students in university.
